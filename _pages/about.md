My name is Damith Senadeera and I am a PhD student in **Computer Science and AI** at [Queen Mary University of London (QMUL)](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/), affiliated with the [Digital Environment Research Institute (DERI)](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/deri/). My research focuses on **Deep Learning for Violence Detection**, specifically video-based Violence Detection using Action Recognition. My primary PhD supervisor from QMUL is **[Prof. Greg Slabaugh](http://eecs.qmul.ac.uk/profiles/slabaughgreg.html)** and **[Dr. Dimitrios Kollias](https://sites.google.com/view/dimitrioskollias/)** from QMUL serves as my secondary supervisor. I'm also being mentored by my industry supversor **[Dr. Robert Yang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robert-x-yang-a979751b/)** from Remark AI which partly sponsors my PhD.

I am particularly interested in modeling Vioelnce Detection for Surveillance Videos as an Action Recognition problem using Deep Learning. My work aims to introduce novel techniques that effectively combine differnet extracted features to produce efficient and accurate models to be deployed in real-world systems to detect violent activities which can also be interpretable.


## Previous Experience 

I have diverse experience in artificial intelligence, deep learning, and data science across academia and industry. As a Research Assistant at Queen Mary University of London, I worked on developping deep leanring techniques for deepfake audio detection. At Royal Holloway University of London, I researched AI path planning algorithms to be deployed in an underwater vehicle, I worked as an AI Research Engineer at Cognius.ai in Singapore, where I led deep leanring based NLP development for a conversational AI platform and as a Data Scientist at PrimusSoft in Singapore, I developed predictive analytics for smart buildings.


## Education  
* I obtained my Master's degree in Data Science from the School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science at [Queen Mary University of London (QMUL)](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/eecs/) in the United Kingdom itslef. My final thesis was focused on employing deep learning techniques to generate synthetic text data using controllable text generation models with the help of prompt tuning given a particular sentiment and analyzed the utility of produced artificial data in AI tasks such as model training.

* I received my Bachelor's Degree in Computer science and Engineering from [National Institute of Technology (NIT), Silchar](http://www.nits.ac.in/) in India.
